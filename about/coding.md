These are guidelines for code style and quality that we follow at UseTheSource.

## General 

* no tabs for indentation: 4 spaces.
* comments explain any otherwise implicit intent or purpose; otherwise code must speak for itself.

## Java

* all public classes are documented with Javadoc to state their intent and purpose.
* all public methods are documented with Javadoc to state their intent and purpose.

## Rascal

* all public functions have @doc tags in Rascal tutor format.
