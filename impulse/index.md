# Introduction

IMPULSE is a fork off a project formally known as IMP, which used to be hosted as an Eclipse incubation project. 

The goal of this Eclipse plugin project is to provide a streamlined, extension-point-based, API for IDE developers to build or generate Eclipse plugins for programming languages and domain specific languages.

More information will follow. The project is currently being moved to Use The Source.
